/*

The formula for this is
    n = -(1/30) * log(1 + b/p * (1 - (1 + i)^30)) / log(1 + i)

example output
What is your balance? 5000
What is the APR on the card (as a percent)? 12
What is the monthly payment you can make? 100
It will take you 70 months to pay off this card.

Prompt for the cardâ€™s APR. Do the division internally.
Prompt for the APR as a percentage, not a decimal.
Use a class called PaymentCalculator with a public method called calculateMonthsUntilPaidOff, which takes no parameters and returns the number of months.
Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent for internal calculations
